SYNOPSIS \u00b6 easy-preprocess-av-bag <bag-inbox> <bag-outbox> DESCRIPTION \u00b6 Preprocesses a bag exported by easy-fedora-to-bag which contains AV materials. The resulting bags are then further processed to deposits by easy-convert-bag-to-deposit and ingested into a Data Station. Processing \u00b6 The input is a directory containing bags exported from EASY by easy-fedora-to-bag . The output is a directory containing the preprocessed bags. Each input bag results in two or three output bags, corresponding to one to three versions of the dataset to be created in the Data Station: The original dataset, completed with files that were included as pseudo-files in EASY. A pseudo-files was a reference to a file stored in the dark archive. A new version of the dataset, with the files that were set to accessibility/visibility \"NONE\" removed. A third version of the dataset, with the streaming copies of the audio and video files added. Where to find the content of the pseudo-files and streaming files is specified in the configuration file: pseudoFileSources: darkarchiveDir: # ...location of directory containing dark archive files springfieldDir: # ...location of directory containing files from Springfield (streaming copies) path: # ...location of a CSV file detailing where to find the files The CSV file should have the following format: easy-file-id easy-dataset-id path-in-darcharchive-dir path-in-springfield-dir easy-file:12345 easy-dataset:67890 path/to/file1 path/to/file2 easy-file:23456 easy-dataset:67890 path/to/file3 path/to/file4 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently, this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL8 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-preprocess-av-bag and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-preprocess-av-bag . For installation on systems that do no support RPM and/or systemd: Build the tarball (see next section). Extract it to some location on your system, for example /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-preprocess-av-bag . Start the service with the following command /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-preprocess-av-bag/bin/easy-preprocess-av-bag server /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-preprocess-av-bag/cfg/config.yml BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 17 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-preprocess-av-bag.git cd easy-preprocess-av-bag mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install .
